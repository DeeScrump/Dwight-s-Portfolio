# Dwight-s-Portfolio
This site is to showcase of portfolio of all existing and future projects by myself

# User Story
The user should be able to access the site and find that the navigation bar has links that will take them to the subsection for each corresponding link.  The exception being the Resume link, which will open up the current resume

The user will find that when they click on the "Work" title from the left side bar, it will link them to the first body of work.

The user will find that the first body of work is larger in scale than the remaining works, to distinguish it.

The user will find that hovering over any of the bodies of work, will both cast a shadow and highlight the imagery.

The user will fnd that each image in the body of work is a hyperlink to a related site (actual bodies of work to come in the near future)

The user will find the contact section, has multiple active links that will lead them to social media pages related to contacting me.

The user will find that all items adjust to various size windows, some times adjust entire, while others shrink/grow.
